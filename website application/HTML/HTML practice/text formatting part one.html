<h2><mark> twilight full moon</mark> </h2>

<p>My mother drove me to<b> the air port</b> with the windows rolled down. It was<i> seventy-five</i> degrees in phoenix, the sky a perfect, cloudless  blue. I was wearing my favorite shirt - sleeveless, white eyelet lace; i was wearing it as a farewell gesture. My carry-on item was a parka. </p>

<p>In the Olympic Peninsula of north west Washington State, a<small> small town</small> named Forks exists Under a near-constant cover of clouds. It rains on this inconsequential town more than any other place in the united place in the<del> United states of America</del>.
</p>

<p>It was from this town and its gloomy , omnipresent shade that my mother escaped with me when I was only a few months old . It was in this town that I'd been compelled to spend a month every summer until I was fourteen. That was the year I finally put my foot down these past three summer, my dad, Charlie, vacationed with me in California for two weeks instead. </p>

<p>It was to Forks that I now exiled myself- an action that I took with great horror. I detested Forks.</p>

<p>I loved Phoenix. I loved the sun and the blistering heat. I loved the vigorous, sprawling city.</p>

<p>"Bella," my mom said to me - the last of a thousand times- before I got on the plane. You don't have to do this."</p>
